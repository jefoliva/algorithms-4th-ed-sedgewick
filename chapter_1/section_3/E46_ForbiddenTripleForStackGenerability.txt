1.3.46 Forbidden triple for stack generability. Prove that a permutation can be generated by a stack 
(as in the previous question) if and only if it has no forbidden triple (a, b,c) such that a < b < c 
with c first, a second, and b third (possibly with other intervening integers between c and a and
 between a and b).

ANSWER:
Supposse we have a forbidden triple a < b < c where:
a = 0, b = 1, c = 2

If we push the three numbers in a stack, the element at the top will be 2 (c), if we pop it
the new peek will be 1 (b). Therefore, there is not possible way in which we can pop 0 (a) before 1 (b)
