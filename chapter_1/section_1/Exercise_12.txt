1.1.12 What does the following code fragment print?
	int[] a = new int[10];
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
			a[i] = 9 - i;
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
			a[i] = a[a[i]];
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
			System.out.println(i);

		ANSWER: First loop assigns numbers from 9 to 0 to a[]
		Second loop assing numbers from 0 to 9 to array
		So, finnally it prints numbers from 0 to 9
